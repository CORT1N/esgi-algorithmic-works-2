# This repository was created to demonstrate several algorithms in Python for different data structures

*I did that with another student during my 3rd year in IT studies, at ESGI.*

## Run it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CORT1N/esgi-algorithmic-works-2.git
cd esgi-algorithmic-works-2
python main.py
```

*Measurements made on a Macbook Pro M4 Pro ARM 24gb RAM.*
